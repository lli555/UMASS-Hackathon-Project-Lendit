#LendIt

Description: Many students have random things that they are not using. This ranges from college supplies like textbooks or iClickers to personal items such as video games or books. Others want or need these items, but are forced to buy them since they arenâ€™t able to get them free. This website application aims to increase the affordability and sustainability of college by enabling easy access to the borrowing and lending of these items.
